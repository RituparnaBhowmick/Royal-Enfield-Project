  <hr><h1><strong>Know About Royal Enfield</strong></h1></hr>

  <p><em>In the mid-1960s, as the British manufacturers tried desperately to survive the tsunami wave of Japanese motorcycles entering the market,
    a British bike called the Royal Enfield Interceptor was making waves of its own.
    Powered by a 736cc parallel twin, it was reportedly capable of running the quarter-mile in less than 13 seconds,
    and so of course it appealed to us power-hungry Americans. Unfortunately its heyday was short-lived,
    as Royal Enfield declared bankruptcy in 1967 and closed its doors for good in 1970.
    The Interceptor disappeared into history (for a while), but thanks to the remnants of colonialism,
    a fortuitous joint venture and a motorcycle called the Bullet, the Royal Enfield name lived on.</em>em></p>
